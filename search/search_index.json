Archaeology can claim a special link to the term assemblage, though novel approaches to the concept of assemblage have recently been adopted from the fields of philosophy and political theory. These approaches, bracketed under the term \u2018new materialism\u2019, are discussed here. The introduction to this collection of papers outlines these approaches and evaluates their usefulness for archaeological practice and interpretation. - Bibliography: Hamilakis, Y and Jones, AM. 2017 Archaeology and Assemblage.

DeLanda 2006b), and on the relationship between parts and wholes (cf. Buchanan 2015). These have been, of course, important matters for archaeological theory for some time now (Chapman 2000; see also below), linked as they are to debates on typology, on hoarding, on accumulation and dispersal, on sets and nets, on deliberate fragmentation and enchainment through fragments, and so on. Furthermore, the discussion on assemblages arrived in archaeology at a moment when two other sets of ideas enjoyed significant popularity in archaeological thinking.

The fact that assemblage is also a key concept in Bennett\u2019s work facilitated further such fusion. Finally, it is admittedly much easier for Anglo-Saxon literature to connect with works such as DeLanda\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s (even Latour\u2019s), than it is with the works of Deleuze and Guattari, produced in (and often responding to) a different intellectual, social and political milieu.</p> <p>Page 4 [[2020-09-09#2:18 pm]]</p> <p>[!quote|#fee832] Highlight DeLanda\u2019s assemblage theory undervalues the key role of affect and of sensoriality (cf.

Many Twitch streamers broadcast from their homes, making domestic space central to questions of placemaking for this rapidly growing digital media form. Within the home, bedrooms merit particular attention because they carry particular cultural connotations; they are associated with intimacy, embodiment, and erotics. Drawing from observations of gaming and nongaming streams, we map where bedrooms do and do not appear on Twitch. We locate the majority of bedrooms in categories that foreground connections between streamers and viewers, like Just Chatting, Music &amp; Performing Arts, and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). By contrast, across a wide range of video game genres, bedrooms remain largely absent from gaming streams. The presence of bedrooms on Twitch also breaks down along gender lines, with women streaming being far more likely to broadcast from their bedrooms than men. Here, we build from existing research on both livestreaming and digital placemaking to argue for an understanding of place on Twitch as fundamentally performative. This performance is inherently gendered and bound up with the affective labor of streaming. In addition, we demonstrate how the bedroom, even when it does not appear on screen, can be understood as a 'structuring logic' of placemaking on Twitch. Given the history of livestreaming, which grows out of women's experiments with online 'lifecasting', the bedroom sets expectations for the type of spatial and emotional access a stream is imagined to offer viewers. In this sense, the absence of bedrooms in gaming streams can be understood as a disavowal of intimate domestic space: an attempt by predominantly male streamers to distance themselves from the implicit parallels between livestreaming and practices like webcam modeling. - Bibliography: Ruberg, B \u2018Bo\u2019 and Lark, D. 2021 Livestreaming from the bedroom: Performing intimacy through domestic space on Twitch.

Building from an understanding of digital space on livestreaming platforms as culturally constructed and fundamentally performative, we ask: What genres of Twitch streams are most often broadcast from the bedroom? What sorts of streamers do or do not include their bedrooms on screen?

Paying attention to the bedroom prompts us to see how bedroom-like elements appear across many genres of Twitch streams. These common elements may be physical items, like soft plushies that recall pillows or lighting that sets an inviting mood, or they might be affective qualities, like performances of place that offer a sense of closeness with the streamer. The practice of streaming from the bedrooms lays plain the invitation to intimacy and access that is inherent in all livestreaming. After all, the basic fact of streaming implies an intimate invitation: entry, via webcam and direct address, into the private space and thoughts of the streamer. Looking to the bedroom as a site of performance on Twitch reminds us that all livestreaming, wherever it takes place, is an intimate, embodied, gendered, and arguably erotic business that often literally takes place in the home. Put in spatial terms, all streaming is streaming from the bedroom.\" (Ruberg and Lark 2021:691)</p> <p>\"The promise of intimacy and access that comes with streaming from the bedroom, where livestreaming was born, also spills out into other areas of the house.

At the same time, the fact that the bedroom looms large in livestreaming even when it is not physically present suggests that streaming itself might be seen as a feminine-coded practice, one that carries an erotic charge both exemplified in and carried over from the bedroom\" (Ruberg and Lark 2021:692)</p>"},{"location":"thoughts/extracted%20public%20annotations%20from%20%40bushvannevarWeMayThink1945/","title":"public annotations from @bushvannevarWeMayThink1945","text":""},{"location":"thoughts/extracted%20public%20annotations%20from%20%40bushvannevarWeMayThink1945/#todorefactor","title":"todo/refactor","text":""},{"location":"thoughts/extracted%20public%20annotations%20from%20%40bushvannevarWeMayThink1945/#as-we-may-think","title":"As We May Think","text":"<p>URL: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true</p> <p>Who is Vannevar Bush?

When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path. The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory.

Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path. The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory.
