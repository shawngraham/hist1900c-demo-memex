> "Many Twitch streamers broadcast from their homes, making domestic space central to questions of placemaking for this rapidly growing digital media form" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:679](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=1))

> "Given the history of livestreaming, which grows out of women's experiments with online 'lifecasting', the bedroom sets expectations for the type of spatial and emotional access a stream is imagined to offer viewers. In this sense, the absence of bedrooms in gaming streams can be understood as a disavowal of intimate domestic space" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:679](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=1))

> "predominantly male streamers to distance themselves from the implicit parallels between livestreaming and practices like webcam modeling." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "Existing scholarship on the relationship between domestic and digital spaces also has yet to fully explore the importance of the bedroom as a site that often stands at the interface between online and offline experience." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "Here, we argue that the erotics of the bedroom are central to placemaking on Twitch, where the bedroom is both a physical location that streamers broadcast from and a conceptual space that structures the practices, aesthetics, and place-related norms of livestreaming on Twitch. Building from an understanding of digital space on livestreaming platforms as culturally constructed and fundamentally performative, we ask: What genres of Twitch streams are most often broadcast from the bedroom? What sorts of streamers do or do not include their bedrooms on screen? And how might attending to the bedroom help us bring to light the gendered, embodied, affective, and sexualized character of place on Twitch? To answer these questions, we performed a series of observations of T" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "Broadly speaking, streams in categories overtly characterized by sociality and affective performance, like Just Chatting, Music & Performing Arts, and autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), were likely to feature bedrooms as backdrops" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "By contrast, video game livestreams that emphasized video game play and mastery were strikingly unlikely to feature bedrooms, instead presenting more generic domestic spaces as backdrops or removing video feeds of streamers entirely." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "This suggests that the matter of where a streamer broadcasts from and how they perform placemaking through their streams is highly gendered" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:680](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=2))

> "In the case of video game streams in particular, our work reveals how strategies for digital placemaking are deployed to distance streamers from the feminized associations of the bedroom: associations which make explicit the parallels between livestreaming and webcam modeling, a form of online sex work." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:681](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=3))

*Where do men vs women stream from in bone trade Tiktok. there is that one user who is explicitly showing off her collection w a cam girl aesthetic ([note on p.681](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=3))*

 

> "In our observations, we focused our attention on how streamers presented space in feeds of themselves, such as whether they appeared to be streaming from a domestic space, how that space was arranged, and what items appeared in it - or how, conversely, streamers chose not to represent interior space, such as by using a green screen or including no video footage at all." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:684](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=6))

> "When we begin to look for bedrooms on Twitch, we see them everywhere - even in the places where, technically, they are not. Paying attention to the bedroom prompts us to see how bedroom-like elements appear across many genres of Twitch streams. These common elements may be physical items, like soft plushies that recall pillows or lighting that sets an inviting mood, or they might be affective qualities, like performances of place that offer a sense of closeness with the streamer. The practice of streaming from the bedrooms lays plain the invitation to intimacy and access that is inherent in all livestreaming. After all, the basic fact of streaming implies an intimate invitation: entry, via webcam and direct address, into the private space and thoughts of the streamer. Looking to the bedroom as a site of performance on Twitch reminds us that all livestreaming, wherever it takes place, is an intimate, embodied, gendered, and arguably erotic business that often literally takes place in the home. Put in spatial terms, all streaming is streaming from the bedroom." ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:691](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=13))

> "The promise of intimacy and access that comes with streaming from the bedroom, where livestreaming was born, also spills out into other areas of the house. W" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:691](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=13))

> "On Twitch, streaming from the bedroom is a practice associated with women streamers and most often deployed by women streamers in categories focused on the connections between streamers and their audiences" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:692](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=14))

> "In one sense, streaming from the bedroom becomes another form of 'women's work' within the digital sphere. At the same time, the fact that the bedroom looms large in livestreaming even when it is not physically present suggests that streaming itself might be seen as a feminine-coded practice, one that carries an erotic charge both exemplified in and carried over from the bedroom" ([Ruberg and Lark 2021:692](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VY85UBSW?page=14))
