"Together these observations map a larger picture of bedrooms on Twitch: where they do appear,  where they do not, and what forms of placemaking are deployed through their construction or  absence.

Rather, they reflect different strategies of  making space through livestreaming with their own particular relationships to issues of intimacy  and access."
