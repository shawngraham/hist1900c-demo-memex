In [[@rubergLivestreamingBedroomPerforming2021]] on [[categories of space|p693]] their method allows them to spot ideas around how gender is reflected through the backgrounds on various twitch streams. If we trained the classifier to attend to the **backgrounds** of bone trade images, I wonder what we might fine? To some degree, this was already there maybe in our [[@grahamFleshingOutBones2018]] paper, but maybe we could also tie to:
