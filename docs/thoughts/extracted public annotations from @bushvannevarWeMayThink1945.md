I love this early UX imagining of the linking/annotation process by Vannevar.  What's notable here of course is that he suggested that creating links between things was a function that something visitors (trailblazers) could do.  In a sense, to him the notion of a hypertext link, and a clickable annotation w/ two targets were mutually interchangeable ideas.  Today, these are distinct.  The idea that a visitor can do this, is only possible within the emerging idea of Open Annotation as we understand it now.  It's why those of us exploring it are so excited about its potential.

This quote:

"he names it, inserts the name in his code book ... the user tabs a single key, and the items are permanently joined"

makes me think of this as an early form of *tagging*.

With the advent of Google Docs we're finally moving away from the archaic indexing mentioned here. The filesystem metaphor was simple and dominated how everyone manages their data-- which extended into how we developed web content, as well.

The declaration that [Hierarchical File Systems are Dead](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/papers/hotos09/) has led to better systems of tagging and search, but we're still far from where we need to be since there is still a heavy focus on the document as a whole instead of *also* the content within the document.

The linearity of printed books is even more treacherously entrenched in our minds than the classification systems used by libraries to store those books.

One day maybe we'll liberate every piece of content from every layer of its concentric cages: artificial systems of indexing, books, web pages, paragraphs, even sentences and words themselves. Only then will we be able to re-dress those thoughts *automatically* into those familiar and comforting forms that keep our thoughts caged.

&mdash;[[ _(aculich)_]]

## Source 
> The real heart of the matter of selection, however, goes deeper than a lag in the adoption of mechanisms by libraries, or a lack of development of devices for their use. Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new path. The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.[^1]

Selection by association, rather than indexing.
&mdash;[[ _(aculich)_]]

## Source 
> Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.[^1]

It kind of blows me mind that the end of WWII is the context for these early dreams of the Internet. Is it the hope experienced in patriotic collaboration toward technological innovation? That's what Bush seems to acknowledge explicitly. It's a techno-militaristic union that haunts us to this day (#prism). But I wonder too if it's the precarious of knowledge, or perhaps the *destructiveness* of knowledge, that also inspires Bush...

This is something we have to keep in mind when developing technology, particularly in academia.  It's not just the technology, but whether it can be put into production in a cost effective and useful manner.  And just because the time is not right now, doesn't mean that as capacities change, it can't be done eventually.

> Two centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which embodied most
of the essential features of recent keyboard devices, but it could not then
come into use. The economics of the situation were against it: the labor
involved in constructing it, before the days of mass production, exceeded the
labor to be saved by its use, since all it could accomplish could be duplicated
by sufficient use of pencil and paper. Moreover, it would have been subject to
frequent breakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that
time and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.[^1]

Agreed. I just found this today via @holden and his Garden and Stream presentation. Been thinking about H and how there is no way to really organize my annotations outside of tags. How do we start to think about connecting all of the artifacts I've collected and annotated that aren't far off from what Bush predicts here? @holden's Federated wiki concept is right on, but maybe too clunky/complex for average joe or student. It helps me to think of H tags as grounding points in a mind map of sorts. Or world clouds with all kinds of different connections. I can visualize that... zoom in and out of the multiple layers of connections I've made between tags...

The author is pointing out how the idea of logic can be a hindrance when analyzing and sharing data. referencing that of mathematicians who are deemed inadequate simply due to the way they express themselves. All very true but very different to take into consideration when reading this work.

## Source 
> Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to
produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have
usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation
transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in
accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the
exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships.[^1]

I thought this was a really interesting evaluation on what exactly progression and evolution is. I never really thought about the ideas that people constantly have and the means that we all have to execution. We always think about the future and what that technology is or could be, but we don't ever talk about it in relation to the past. It made me think what if we sent modern ways that we read (like that book that you showed us) back in time, how would they react to that?

So in this example and in others throughout the piece, a machine takes over a job formerly done by a "girl". This is similar to other examples where digital labor is feminized in subtle and (now) increasingly invisible and insidious ways.

Exactly. Though maybe not binary per se (because it still has to be interpreted by higher level languages and protocols to make sense of it), but you're right that computers and networks depend on universal standards like HTTP, HTML, and on and on. That's why it's so important that these are **open** standards: computers have to know whether they're speaking the right universal language.

I get the sense from his later discussion of expert "trailblazers" that Bush did not imagine a more democratic knowledge production process, as in Wikipedia or Hypothes.is. And I also get the sense that he might not have been excited about that advent. His ideas are pretty firmly routed in traditional notions of scientific authority.

Amplification is an interesting trope in Bush's essay and tech talk in general. It's less about speed than visibility. Certainly works for annotation:

It seems to me that he's using the terms "mechanized" and "automated" more or less interchangeably. As he says, we "cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially," but clearly hyperlinking and other associated technologies allow us to much more readily select by association ... I'm sure most of us have had the "rabbit hole" experience of following a trail of links in which each link suggests the next to be followed.

I would see this as a form of augmentation (in Englebart's sense) rather than automation...for me that's a crucial distinction.

I have an older Dell tablet so I use Polaris Office because I don't have to be connected to internet.   My Prof. Zach Whalen also showed us Hypothesis so I do try to use that as much as possible. I also use Adobe because the highlighting tool works really well, but that is most for readings assigned by classes. Do you have any suggestions?

in addition to the outdated, sexist language, I suspect that a good deal of training and labor are being obfuscated by an image suggesting that operating this machine is basically a leisure activity, perhaps equivalent to "languidly" playing a piano in a parlor on some lazy afternoon (which can't be done either unless the pianist did a good deal of practicing sometime earlier). In short, gendered languge/imagery  is being recruited to underline how easy this machine is to use, and also seems to reveal the author's assumptions about women's work and the skill it does or doesn't require.

There's a very important element that I think is assumed here, and that requires considerable mental labor (and some practice with using the tools described): selection.  If the notes and photographs are to be useful, they can't be a stream-of-consciousness recording of everything encountered, observed, or thought that day.  Otherwise, the "pondering" would take as long as the day itself.  

And presumably the process of "talk[ing] comments into the record" involves yet more selection. That's a natural part of the process of research and writing, but one thing I think we've learned as tools of this sort become widely available is that the temptation to record everything is strong (scholars are not immune to the same impulses experienced by students with highlighters), and the result is a postponement of the difficult task of selecting what's important to a later date (or sometimes never).

Indeed.  One key factor is that you need to know what you might want to look for in the future at the point when you set up the system (or you need to be willing to go back and re-code the data periodically, or to accept that coding will be incomplete because it's only updated under certain circumstances -- a new employee, or a strong enough need for particular information to justify the cost of re-coding). 

So a key question becomes: do we know that we want to know?  do we know what we'll want to know in one year? five years? over the lifetime of this system (because all systems do have lifetimes)?

One major difference between the memex as envisioned here and most web-based systems is that each individual who has a memex (which presumably isn't everyone; they sound expensive) has his (or her?) own memex.  To use the trail metaphor, everyone has his own network of trails on his own island, and while it's possible to reproduce a network of trails from someone else's island on one's own island, the two sets of trails don't really connect (nor does there seem to be a chance for serendipitous connections made by people who don't know each other already).

I found myself checking Bush's age at time of writing when I read this: c. 55.  As a fellow middle-aged person, I can sympathize with his desire, but am inclined to point out that the problem is not just finding something that might be useful, but remembering that it exists in the first place (I guess the "trails" might help with that, assuming one remembers one made a trail, or has a way of stumbling across it).

As someone who studies race (but not primarily in this period), I took note of the easy use of the language, and wondered exactly whom he would mentally include in the "race" (it does seem to be explicitly singular here) he was writing about.  Working from the little I know of him and the text itself, I'd say that he was certainly part of a scientific community that included prominent Jewish members, so it seems that his sense of "the race" possessing and creating this collective scientific knowledge would (or at least should) include Jews (and so wouldn't mirror Nazi mapping of racial  categories, at least not exactly).  But would he include people of African origin (living in Africa or in the diaspora)?  What about the many peoples of Asia (whom he might or might not see as a single "race"), and especially the recently-defeated Japanese?  

It's definitely language (like the evocation of "girls" throughout the piece) that raises questions for a C21 reader, but I'm seeing less material for teasing out ideas about race than about gender in the essay as a whole.

On first reading, this seemed like a very odd transition, from talking about new ways to navigate the ever-proliferating piles/sea of data, to talking about instruments that seem more likely to add to the piles than to organize it.  It takes some time for him to come back to how photography can help solve the problem.  If this were a student paper, I'd probably be telling him to move his thesis/solution closer to the beginning, so readers don't lose it in the mass of his own accumulated examples of technological progress.

In this case, what happens to the "process of digestion and correction" which follows "the first stage"?  In some ways, we do now have something like this: many more records of the early stages of thinking (including these annotations), in addition to or instead of records of the later stages, after an author has done more "digesting" of his/her thoughts, and published them in a more orderly way.  There's a lot to be said for this sort of "thinking in the open," but it also adds exponentially to the "record," which Bush is already finding overwhelming in size.

The role of those in power is definitely obscured here. Someone is presumably writing the "instructions" (algorithms, in today's parlance) that the "girls" ("data processors" of varying genders today) are feeding to the machines.  The system doesn't run by itself; someone has to decide what questions the data should be used to answer, and that is the position of power (think Big Brother and/or Big Business more than scientists today).  

Equally important, who will write the "instructions" and hand them to the "girls" to feed to the machine?  There's a key and very powerful actor being left out here: the

Yes and no. Mental association (one of the "pathways" of human memory) is neurologically processed, and it is idiosyncratic and singular, rather than the result of a principle of indexing. On the other hand, if one is talking about association by "proximity" on a web page, for example, then we are back to "location," processed digitally, which can then be "indexed" by web crawling. So... yes, mechanical or digital association can be seen as a form of indexing. These two distinct processes are not analogous. (Pardon the pun.)

Tagging mechanisms and other such tools bridge the gap between organic neuro-processed association as a kind of index and "mechanical" indexing. Basically, human brains imprint the digital archive with some traces of their own organic associations. Not exactly a reproduction of the organic process, but creating a bridge between the organic "pulling together" of disparate elements and mechanical indexing.

... a matchbox or a USB thumb drive or a flat smart media card or a minuscule microchip or even a non-substantial set of information on a server on the cloud somewhere that can be streamed almost instantly anywhere in the world. In one sense, 21st-century digital "compression" leads not to density, but to dispersion and to widespread, easy access through ubiquitous devices and software tools.

1. Mathematics can be used to describe and calculate quantity/scale, position or probability; it makes sense to map this "new symbolism" onto one of those dimensions.
2. This reminds one of a passage from Richard Powers *The Gold Bug Variations* (1991) where he reminds us that a sufficiently precise placement and measurement of a notch on a rod would be able to encode and decode the Encyclopedia Britannica, indeed, the full holdings of the Library of Congress.
3. Let us remember that the nearly instantaneous calculations of the computers we use today have limits in terms of the numbers of digits that may be processed at any one time; for that reason, the kind of highly compressed mathematical encoding that Powers envisioned is virtually impossible for us in the early 21st century.

Great question. Coming out of the horrors of WWII, I think humanitarian optimism was Bush's only option. Humanity needed to do better, and people were prepared to work together to make it happen. Today it seems people are drawn to IT for the financial rewards. Our culture celebrates the billionaire individuals, and not the possibilities of what we can do together.

For physical objects, however, additive manufacturing may revolutionize the space and drop barriers to entry. Case in point, a (unverified) post I saw today about someone 3D printing their own Invisaline-style braces. If we make it to strong artificial intelligence, the same will happen for computing/programming.
