### ToDo

(I tagged certain notes with #todo then did a search for that tag; I copied the results as markdown links and pasted below.)

- [[@grahamFleshingOutBones2018]]
- [[@hamilakisArchaeologyAssemblage2017]]
- [[extracted notes from @rubergLivestreamingBedroomPerforming2021-zotero]]
- [[extracted public annotations from @bushvannevarWeMayThink1945]]
- [[more research fewer insights]]

*Thing I found out* - if I put a ? in a note name (and probably any other special character) github actions breaks the link to the note.
